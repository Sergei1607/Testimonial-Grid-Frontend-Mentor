                        <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I nedded some structure from
                            professionals who can help me lear programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a 
                            former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire 
                            curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long 
                            for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning
                            to the next level in a way that not tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it
                            during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a 
                            full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
